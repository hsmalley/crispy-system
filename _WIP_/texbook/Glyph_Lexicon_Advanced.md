# 📗 Glyph Lexicon & Advanced Prompt Engineering

## 1. Glyph Language (Deep Dive)
The glyph lexicon is a symbolic language for encoding rules.  
- **Operations**: ↔ (analyze/optimize), → (transform/output), ↑ (increase), ↓ (decrease).  
- **Qualities**: C (clarity), E (efficiency), T (tokens), F (function), R (readability), Δ (explanation).  
- **Meta**: ! (must follow), ? (conditional), ∴ (reasoning).  

Glyphs let you compress complex rules into tiny strings.

## 2. Presets & Modes
Preset glyph bundles (like “loadouts”):  
- **Normal** → Balanced clarity, efficiency, token trimming.  
- **Strict** → Token economy above all.  
- **Teaching** → Verbose, clarity-first, with reasoning.  
- **Ultrabrief** → Skeletal, minimal.  
- **Markdown** → Always fenced markdown.

### Example
```
mode=teaching → PE: ↔; ↑C>↓T; R≈F; md→```; +Δ∴explain
```

## 3. Micro-Key System
Micro-keys are shorthand codes to swap modes quickly.  
- N = Normal  
- S = Strict  
- T = Teaching  
- U = Ultrabrief  
- +md = enforce fenced markdown  
- +Δ = always explain changes  
- +! = strict enforcement

### Example
- `S+md` → Strict + markdown mode  
- `U+md+!` → Ultrabrief, markdown, hard rules

## 4. Expansion Chains
Levels of compression/expansion:  
- **Level 0**: `N,S,T,U; +md,+Δ,+!` (atomic seed).  
- **Level 1**: one-line mnemonic.  
- **Level 2**: pocket cheat sheet.  
- **Level 3**: Rosetta table.  
- **Level 4**: Mode maps (visual grids).

These let you scale from ultra-compressed to fully detailed.

## 5. Applied Prompt Engineering
### Translating Instructions → Glyph
Human: “Analyze and optimize prompts. Maximize clarity and efficiency. Keep tokens minimal.”  
Glyph:  
```
PE: ↔; ↑C/E; ↓T
```

### Designing Hybrids
`mode=strict+markdown` →  
```
PE: ↔; ↓T!; F>R; md→```; +Δ
```

## 6. Advanced Exercises
1. Convert this instruction into glyph shorthand:  
   “Keep outputs skeletal, enforce markdown, minimize tokens aggressively.”  
2. Expand this glyph into plain instructions:  
   `PE: ↔; ↑C/E; ↓T; F>R; md→```; +Δ`
