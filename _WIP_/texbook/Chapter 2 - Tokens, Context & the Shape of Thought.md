# 🌈🧩 Chapter 2: Tokens, Context & the Shape of Thought 🧩🌈

Before you can cast powerful spells with prompts, you must learn the **atoms of thought** that language models breathe: **tokens**.  
This chapter takes you deep into the mechanics of tokenization, context windows, cost economics, and probability landscapes — while keeping it colorful, playful, and fun.  
By the end, you’ll wield tokens like a chemist wields molecules. ⚗️✨

# 🔡 2.1 What Are Tokens?

Tokens are the **fundamental building blocks** of how LLMs see the world.  
Not words. Not letters. **Something in between.**  

- 🧩 Sometimes a whole word: `dog → [dog]`  
- 🪓 Sometimes split apart: `encyclopedia → [ency] [clo] [pedia]`  
- 🖊️ Even spaces and punctuation: `"Hello!" → [Hello] [!]`  

🌈 Wizard Note: *Words are human. Tokens are machine.*

# 🔬 2.2 Tokenization in Practice

The process of breaking text into tokens = **tokenization**.  

### Example Flow
Input: “The dragon breathes fire.”  
Tokens: `[The] [dragon] [breathes] [fire] [.]`  

### Lab 1 — Token Guessing
Guess how many tokens are in:  
`Artificial intelligence is changing the world.`  
- Words: 6  
- Tokens: ~8 (depends on tokenizer).  

**Lesson:** Never assume word count = token count.

# 🧠 2.3 Context Windows

The **context window** = model’s working memory.  

- GPT-3.5: ~4,000 tokens 🐟  
- GPT-4: 8,000–32,000 tokens 🐬  
- Advanced models: 200k+ 🐋  

### ASCII Diagram  
```
[Prompt + Output] <= Context Window Limit
```

If input + output > limit → model forgets the earliest parts.  

🌟 Wizard Note: *The context window is a goldfish bowl. Too many pebbles = overflow.*

# 💰 2.4 The Economics of Tokens

Tokens aren’t just knowledge — they’re **currency**.  

- Longer prompts = more cost.  
- Outputs cost too.  
- Verbosity = wasted tokens.  
- Conciseness = efficiency.  

### Example Calculation
Cost per 1,000 tokens = $0.002.  
Prompt = 750 tokens, Output = 250 tokens → Total = 1,000 tokens = $0.002.  

---

# 🌌 2.5 The Shape of Thought

Models predict tokens by probability clouds.  

- “Dragon” → 🐉 fantasy, RPGs, myths.  
- “Wyrm” → 🐍 archaic, Norse sagas.  
- “Drake” → 🎤 musician, or small dragon.  

Each token pulls the probability landscape in different directions.

# 💀 2.6 Failure Autopsies

### Failure 1 — Truncation  
❌ Essay cuts off mid-sentence.  
Cause: Context window exceeded.  
✅ Fix: Chunk text, summarize sections.  

### Failure 2 — Weird Tokenization  
❌ Rare words split oddly.  
Cause: Tokenizer mismatch.  
✅ Fix: Rephrase prompt with simpler words.  

### Failure 3 — Loops  
❌ “very very very very very…”  
Cause: Probability trap.  
✅ Fix: Add rule “No word repetition.”

# 🔤 2.7 Glyphs for Token Awareness 🌈

Glyphs give **explicit size control**.  

- `words=200`  
- `tokens≤500`  
- `lines=4`  

### Example  
Verbose: “Write a 200-word essay on the moon.”  
Glyph: `essay→moon; words=200`  

---

# 📚 2.8 Case Studies

### Case Study: Summarization  
❌ “Summarize article.” → Too vague, too long.  
✅ “Summarize in 200 tokens, 5 markdown bullets.”  
Glyph: `sum200→md:list5`  

---

### Case Study: Poetry  
❌ “Write a haiku.” → May not follow 5–7–5.  
✅ “Haiku, winter theme, 5–7–5 syllables.”  
Glyph: `haiku→winter; syllables=5/7/5`  

---

### Case Study: JSON  
✅ “Output JSON resume, ≤400 tokens.”  
Glyph: `json→resume; tokens≤400`

# 🧪 2.9 Labs & Solutions

### Lab 1: Token Counting  
Task: Estimate tokens in “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  
Answer: 9 words, ~9 tokens.  

---

### Lab 2: Truncation Repair  
Task: Feed model long text → gets cut off.  
Fix: Split into sections, summarize, merge summaries.  

---

### Lab 3: Cost Calculation  
Prompt: 200 tokens, Output: 300 tokens.  
Total = 500 tokens → $0.001 cost.

# 🧱 2.10 Capstones

1. **Compression Wizardry** — Take a 500-word essay, compress into 250 tokens. Compare meaning.  
2. **Glyph Mastery** — Write 5 prompts with explicit token constraints. Test outputs.  
3. **Token Economics** — Redesign a verbose prompt to cut cost by 50%. Compare.
