# 🌈🔗 Chapter 6: Prompt Chains & Multi-Step Reasoning — Building Workflows of Thought 🔗🌈

Single prompts are like **fireworks**: dazzling, but fleeting.  
Chains are like **engines**: sustained, structured, and powerful.  
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to chain prompts together into **systems of reasoning**, transforming the AI from a parrot into an **orchestra of thought**. 🎼✨

# 🔄 6.1 Why Chains Matter

- 🤯 One-off prompts = fragile, inconsistent.  
- 🧩 Chains mimic human thought = step-by-step reasoning.  
- 🚀 Pipelines = repeatable, reliable, automatable.  

🌈 Wizard Note: *Prompts are spells. Chains are grimoires.*  

## 🧠 Cognitive Science Parallel  
Human reasoning itself works like chains: we rarely jump to conclusions in one move. We:  
1. Gather information.  
2. Form hypotheses.  
3. Test ideas.  
4. Revise and refine.  

Prompt chains mimic this **scientific method of thought**.  

## ⚙️ Programming Parallel  
Prompt chains are like **Unix pipes**:  
```
cat data.txt | grep "error" | sort | uniq -c
```  
Each step transforms input → output → next step.  
Prompts should be **pipeable spells**.

# 📚 6.2 Types of Chains

### 1. Sequential Chains  
Linear progression.  
Example: Brainstorm → Outline → Write Essay.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
seq: brainstorm→outline→essay
```  

---

### 2. Branching Chains  
Explore options, then merge.  
Example: Generate 3 business ideas → evaluate → pick best.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
branch: ideas3→{eval1|eval2|eval3}→select_best
```  

---

### 3. Reflective Chains  
Self-correction loops.  
Example: Draft → Critique → Repair → Final.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
reflect: draft→critique→repair→final
```  

---

### 4. Parallel Chains  
Split tasks for efficiency.  
Example: Analyze tone, facts, style separately → merge.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
parallel: split→analyze{tone,facts,style}→merge
```

# 💀 6.3 Failure Atlas (Expanded)

### Failure 1 — Forgotten Steps  
❌ Step B ignores Step A’s output.  
✅ Fix: Reinforce context each time.  

### Failure 2 — Loops Without Progress  
❌ Endless critique-repair loop.  
✅ Fix: add max iterations.  

### Failure 3 — Contradictions  
❌ A = short, B = long.  
✅ Fix: align constraints early.  

### Failure 4 — Token Exhaustion  
❌ Chain too long, context window exceeded.  
✅ Fix: chunk inputs + summarize.  

### Failure 5 — Role Collapse  
❌ Role instructions lost mid-chain.  
✅ Fix: repeat roles explicitly each step.  

🌈 Glyph Repairs:  
```
chain→check{role,scope,tokens}
```

# 🧪 6.4 Labs & Debugging Walkthroughs

### Lab 1 — Multi-Step Essay Writer  
- Step A: Generate outline.  
- Step B: Expand → essay.  
- Step C: Summarize → 200 tokens.  

❌ **Failure Case:** Summary ignores essay, just generic.  
✅ **Fix:** Remind model: "Summarize THIS essay only."  

---

### Lab 2 — RPG Pipeline  
- Step A: Worldbuild.  
- Step B: NPCs.  
- Step C: Encounters.  
- Step D: Dialogue.  

❌ **Failure:** NPCs contradict world rules.  
✅ **Fix:** Carry context across all steps.  

---

### Lab 3 — Debugging Chains  
Broken chain: “Outline → Essay → Summary (≤200)” produced 400 words.  
✅ Fix: Add explicit token control at summary step.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
outline→essay→sum200
```

# 🔤 6.6 Glyphs for Chains 🌈

- Sequential: `A→B→C`  
- Reflective: `draft→critique→repair→final`  
- Parallel: `split→analyze{X,Y,Z}→merge`  
- Branching: `A→{B1|B2|B3}→C`  

🌈 Nested Glyph Example:  
```
ideas→branch{eval,critique}→merge→sum200
```

# 🧱 6.7 Capstones

1. **Story Builder**  
Outline → Draft → Critique → Repair → Finalize.  

2. **Panel of Experts**  
Roles: Scientist, Philosopher, Artist.  
Each answers. Merge consensus.  

3. **Branching Adventure Engine**  
User choice drives chain → different outcomes.  

4. **Parallel Fact Checker**  
Split claim into sources.  
Verify independently.  
Merge verdict.

# 🌈 Chapter 6 Summary 🌈

- Chains = workflows of thought.  
- Types: sequential, branching, reflective, parallel.  
- Expanded Failure Atlas covers forgotten steps, loops, contradictions, token loss, role collapse.  
- Labs teach step-by-step debugging.  
- Case studies show real pipelines (support, research, game design).  
- Glyph shorthand compresses chains for speed.  
- Capstones simulate full real-world workflows.  

🎓 With chains, you move from sparks to **engines of reasoning**.  
The next chapter teaches you to wield **memory and persistence** to extend those chains across entire conversations. 🌌🔥
