# 🌈🔗 Chapter 6: Prompt Chains & Multi-Step Reasoning — Building Workflows of Thought 🔗🌈

Single prompts are like **fireworks**: dazzling, but fleeting.  
Chains are like **engines**: sustained, structured, and powerful.  
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to chain prompts together into **systems of reasoning**, transforming the AI from a parrot into an **orchestra of thought**. 🎼✨

# 🔄 6.1 Why Chains Matter

- 🤯 One-off prompts = fragile, inconsistent.  
- 🧩 Chains mimic human thought = step-by-step reasoning.  
- 🚀 Pipelines = repeatable, reliable, automatable.  

🌈 Wizard Note: *Prompts are sparks. Chains are grimoires. Pipelines are living libraries.*  

## 🧠 Cognitive Science Parallel  
Humans rarely think in one step. We:  
1. Gather information.  
2. Form hypotheses.  
3. Test ideas.  
4. Revise and refine.  

Prompt chains mimic this **scientific method of thought**.  

## ⚙️ Programming Parallel  
Prompt chains are like **Unix pipes**:  
```
cat data.txt | grep "error" | sort | uniq -c
```  
Each step transforms input → output → next step.  
Prompts should be **pipeable spells**.

# 📚 6.2 Types of Chains

### 1. Sequential Chains  
Linear progression.  
Example: Brainstorm → Outline → Essay.  
🌈 Glyph:  
```
seq: brainstorm→outline→essay
```  

---

### 2. Branching Chains  
Explore options, then merge.  
Example: Generate 3 ideas → evaluate → choose best.  
🌈 Glyph:  
```
branch: ideas3→{eval1|eval2|eval3}→select_best
```  

---

### 3. Reflective Chains  
Self-correction loops.  
Example: Draft → Critique → Repair → Final.  
🌈 Glyph:  
```
reflect: draft→critique→repair→final
```  

---

### 4. Parallel Chains  
Split tasks for efficiency.  
Example: Analyze tone, facts, style separately → merge.  
🌈 Glyph:  
```
parallel: split→analyze{tone,facts,style}→merge
```  

---

### 5. Hybrid & Nested Chains  
Chains within chains.  
🌈 Glyph:  
```
nested: (draft→critique) + (facts→check) → merge→final
```

# 💀 6.3 Failure Atlas (Expanded)

### Failure 1 — Forgotten Steps  
❌ Step B ignores Step A.  
✅ Fix: Reinforce context explicitly.  

### Failure 2 — Loops Without Progress  
❌ Endless cycle of critique-repair.  
✅ Fix: Add max iterations.  

### Failure 3 — Contradictions  
❌ A = short, B = long.  
✅ Fix: align constraints.  

### Failure 4 — Token Exhaustion  
❌ Chain too long → cutoff.  
✅ Fix: chunk + summarize.  

### Failure 5 — Role Collapse  
❌ Role lost mid-chain.  
✅ Fix: restate role each step.  

### Failure 6 — Branch Drift  
❌ Branches diverge wildly.  
✅ Fix: evaluation stage before merge.  

### Failure 7 — Parallel Merge Chaos  
❌ Tone vs facts vs style clash.  
✅ Fix: weighted merge rules.  

### Failure 8 — Chain Overfitting  
❌ Too rigid, misses nuance.  
✅ Fix: allow exploratory substeps.  

🌈 Glyph Repair:  
```
chain→check{role,scope,tokens,merge}
```

# 🧪 6.4 Labs & Debugging Walkthroughs

### Lab 1: Multi-Step Essay Writer  
❌ Broken: Outline vague → essay rambling → summary generic.  
✅ Debug: refine outline, enforce scope in essay, token cap summary.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
outline→essay→sum200
```  

---

### Lab 2: RPG Pipeline  
❌ NPCs contradict world rules.  
✅ Debug: carry context into NPC step.  

Steps:  
- Step A: Build world.  
- Step B: Generate NPCs.  
- Step C: Encounters.  
- Step D: Dialogue.  

---

### Lab 3: Detective Mystery 🕵️  
❌ Chain fails: suspects contradict evidence.  
✅ Debug: evaluation checkpoint before verdict.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
clues→suspects→eval{evidence}→verdict
```  

---

### Lab 4: Branching Adventure  
❌ Broken branch: dead-end or nonsense.  
✅ Debug: add fallback narrative rules.  

---

### Lab 5: Startup Pitch Pipeline  
❌ Step B pitch contradicts Step A idea.  
✅ Debug: inject “business idea ID” each step.  

---

### Lab 6: Parallel Review  
❌ Merge chaos: tone vs style vs facts.  
✅ Debug: weighted merge → clarity first.  

🌈 Glyph:  
```
parallel: analyze{tone,style,facts}→merge{weights=clarity>tone}
```

# 📚 6.5 Extended Case Studies

### Case Study A: Customer Support Pipeline  
Intent → Docs → Rewrite → Eval → Final.  

### Case Study B: Academic Research Workflow  
Question → Lit review → Summaries → Draft → Peer review.  

### Case Study C: Game Design Pipeline  
Concept → Mechanics → Narrative → Balance → Doc.  

### Case Study D: Multi-Role Debate  
Expert1 + Expert2 + Expert3 → Debate → Consensus merge.

# 🔤 6.6 Glyphs for Chains 🌈

- Sequential: `A→B→C`  
- Reflective: `draft→critique→repair→final`  
- Parallel: `split→analyze{X,Y,Z}→merge`  
- Branching: `A→{B1|B2|B3}→C`  
- Nested: `(A→B) + (C→D) → merge`  

🌈 Nested Example:  
```
(draft→critique) + (facts→check) → merge→sum200
```

# 🧱 6.7 Capstones (Epic)

1. **Story Builder**  
Outline → Draft → Critique → Repair → Final.  

2. **Panel of Experts**  
Roles: Scientist, Philosopher, Artist. Debate → merge consensus.  

3. **Branching Detective Mystery**  
Clues → Suspects → Eval → Verdict. Multiple endings.  

4. **Startup Incubator Pipeline**  
Idea → Critique → Pitch → Investor Q&A → Revised pitch.
